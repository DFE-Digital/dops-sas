            <p>This is a beta product.</p>

            All known issues and bugs can be found on the <a
                href="https://github.com/orgs/DFE-Digital/projects/39">GitHub repo (opens in new tab)</a> for this
            service.

        </div>

        <p>If you decide to use this product in your organisation, please fork, and contribute changes into the main
            repository.</p>

            <p>If you want to contribute to this product, you may want to <a href="" target="_blank">check our backlog</a> for features we have not yet implemented and are looking for help with.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Expected setup timescales</h2>

            <p>If you follow these instructions step by step, it should take around 1.5 hours from starting, to using the service.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Prerequisites</h2>

        <p>This is a beta product which we are testing the suitability for supporting the service assessment process in
            a government department, we are using low-cost hosting and database provision to keep costs at a minimum.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Hosting</h3>
        <p>This service is hosted using Heroku. It is sufficient for the intermittent, non-continuous use of the
            product.</p>
        <p>We use a standard eco dyno which is about Â£6 a month.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Database</h3>
        <p>We use a Postgres database which is provided as an add-on in Heroku.</p>
        <p>We are using a Free tier instance which is sufficient for supporting this product.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Notify</h3>
        <p>We use GOV.UK Notify to send emails from this service.</p>
        <p>All templates and parameters are detailed in the GitHub repo in the <a href=""
                target="_blank">email_templates folder</a>.</p>
        <p>This is free for government use.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Codebase</h2>
        <p>We chose to build this product using Node.JS. This enables the product to be built and contributed to, by a
            wide range of people, who might not normally contribute code had we built it using Ruby or C#.
        </p>
        <p>This also enables us to build quickly, make use of common components and patterns more easily, and be
            supported by a team familiar with the tech stack used.</p>
